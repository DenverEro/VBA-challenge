# VBA-challenge
In this homework assignment, we were given an quarterly stocks data and asked to write VBA script to work with the data. I wrote a script to run simulatenously across all 4 worksheets, and that script calculated quarterly change, percent change, total stock volume, and more.

I took baby steps to write this code starting with writing the stock name to the ticker table, adjusted to write the name only once in the ticker table, adjusted to write the names consecutively on the ticker table, etc. I reached out to chatGPT for assistance to find the first and last row for each stock and (especially) for the variables and logic for the % increase/decrease and greatest total volume.
